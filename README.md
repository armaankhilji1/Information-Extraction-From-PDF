**PDF Question Answering System**

A Streamlit-based app that allows you to upload a PDF and then ask questions directly from it.
The system uses LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, FAISS vector store, and Google Gemini API to retrieve and answer questions from the uploaded PDF.

**How to Run**
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-folder>

2. Create Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv

3. Activate Virtual Environment:

Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the App:
streamlit run app.py

**Usage**
1. Upload any PDF document.
2. Type your question in the input box.
3. Get answers extracted directly from the PDF.
4. Expand the section to see retrieved PDF chunks for reference.


**Approach and Design Choices**
The goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective PDF Question Answering system.

1. **PDF Processing**  
   - Used `PyPDF2` to extract text from uploaded PDFs.  
   - Text is split into overlapping chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter` to ensure context is preserved.

2. **Embeddings & Vector Store**  
   - Used `HuggingFace Embeddings (multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1)` to generate vector representations of text chunks.  
   - Stored embeddings in **FAISS**, an efficient similarity search index.

3. **LLM (Answer Generation)**  
   - Integrated **Google Gemini** via `langchain_google_genai`.  
   - A strict system prompt ensures that the model answers only using the documentâ€™s content, avoiding hallucinations.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**  
   - Built with **Streamlit** for a clean, interactive interface.  
   - Users upload a PDF, ask questions, and view exact text chunks retrieved from the document.  

This design ensures accuracy (answers directly from PDF) while keeping the system simple and fast.
